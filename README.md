# 🧩 Experiment 3.2 – Spring & Hibernate Java Application

### 📘 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build Java applications using **Spring Framework** and **Hibernate ORM** for:
- Dependency Injection (DI)
- CRUD Operations
- Transaction Management *(optional extension)*

It’s divided into three parts — **A** and **B** are implemented here.

**Key Concepts:**
- `@Configuration` and `@Bean` annotations  
- Constructor-based dependency injection  
- `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` for context initialization  

**Classes:**
